# Lycoris Recoil Wallpaper
This is my first-ever release for the wallpaper engine, this is based on the anime lycoris recoil. It has two modes light and dark mode and offers audio when you hover over the pictures, it also saves the data for your preferred settings if which mode you want, and if you want to have a clock or audio visualizer between the backgrounds.
